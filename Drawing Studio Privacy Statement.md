**Other Hints**

Windows Store app has very very strict limitaion, apps can only access files in some strict limited locations (like  Music/Videos Libraries, but have to declare capabilities in appxmanifest, they are listed on the store download page, downloading also means user allow them)  directly, and they run in sandbox, so they are much safer than desktop applications.
